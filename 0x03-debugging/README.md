## Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmerand an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.


## General
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages


## Requirements


  * General
  * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  * All your files should end with a new line
  * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
  * A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
  * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

## Rubber Duck Debugging: The Psychology of How it Works

 * Computers process information differently than humans do. Anyone who’s first learning to program understands this well. What’s hard about programming   for a beginner isn’t really big hard esoteric concepts, but that you’ve got to be so painfully exacting in how you describe everything to a (dumb) co   mputer. That’s why we do rubber duck debugging.

 * But to keep on my first thread, because it illustrates why rubber ducks (or inanimate objects, or pets, or speechless-children) can help you fix erro   rs in code. After we explain that a bit more, we’ll get to making sure we know why “rubber duck debugging” is such a popular technique, and what that   tells us about human psychology.
